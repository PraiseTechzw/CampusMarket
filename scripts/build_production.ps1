Campus Market Production Build Summary
=====================================
Build Date: $buildDate
Git Commit: $buildCommit
Flutter Version: $flutterVersion

Build Artifacts:
- Android APK: build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
- Android AAB: build\app\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab
- Web: build\web\

Next Steps:
1. Test the built applications
2. Upload APK to Google Play Store or distribute directly
3. Upload AAB to Google Play Store for optimized distribution
4. Deploy web version to hosting service

Build Configuration:
- APK: Multi-architecture (arm, arm64, x64)
- AAB: Optimized for Google Play Store
- Web: Production-optimized with tree shaking
